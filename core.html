          <h3>Areas of Strength</h3>
          <p>
            <em><b>I am inspired by the future.</b></em>
          </p>
          <p>
            Thinking about all of the possibilities of tomorrow, all of the work being done to bring it to fruition, and the fact that I'll be a part of it gets me incredibly excited.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em><b>I really enjoy communicating and discussing ideas.</b></em>
          </p>
          <p>Building upon the previous point, I thoroughly enjoy being involved in stimulating conversations. I love getting to know people, team strategizing, giving presentations, and really just exploring everyone's uniqueness.
          </p>
          <p>  
            <em><b>I consider problem solving to be a thrill.</b></em>
          </p>
          <p>Anything from technical problems to social conflicts, I enjoy solving problems and finding clever ways to obtain the best solutions. I am bored whenever I don't have a problem to solve.</p>
          <p>  
            <em><b>I am a meticulous analyzer.</b></em>
          </p>
          <p>Breaking down things to its core components and figuring out its inner workings are not just something I enjoy now; it is something that happens almost instinctively. Finding the common denominator between instance <em>x</em> and how it's similar to previous problems is always fun.</p>
          <p>
            <em><b>I am extremely driven.</b></em>
          </p>
          <p>Given a task or a goal, I do all I can to ensure that it is done to the best of my ability. I demand excellence from myself in everything that I do.</p>
        </div>
        <div class = "col-md-6">
          <h3>Areas of Improvement</h3>
          <p>
            <em><b>I'm reluctant to ask for help.</b></em>
          </p>
          <p>Traditionally, I'm used to be able to solve problems independently. I had the impression that you learned most thoroughly when you go about understanding a topic on your own. However, as I grow older and the problems get more difficult, I am required to ask for assistance. Not only have I felt like I understand more actively discussing ideas, I've also creating valuable relationships in the process. Consequently, I have increasingly seen the effectiveness and the importance of asking for assistance and collaboration.</p>
          <p>
            <em><b>I am sometimes indecisive.</b></em>
          </p>
          <p>Analyzing all possible outcomes in hopes of finding the best one sometimes stifles me. I'll get paralyzed thinking and weighing my options and sometimes forget to act. On some occasions, this has reaped worse results than some of the ones in deliberation. Accordingly, I've been making an effort to still weigh my options, but also act in a timely manner, as some opportunities you only get one chance.</p>
          <p>
          <p>
            <em><b>I get discouraged by defeat.</b></em>
          </p>
          <p>Oftentimes, I compare my success against the success of others. While this can arguably be seen as a strength, as I have made it pretty far doing just this, it can often be self-destructive. If I see peer of mine excelling, I begin to question what they have that I don't. I now instead begin to look more optimistically. To be surrounded by many intelligent people must mean I'm at some level comparable to them.</p>
